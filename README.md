# Plannel

Plannel is a mobile app designed to facilitate the planning and organisation of any travel. Aimed at travellers and tourists, the app provides a platform that allows users to efficiently coordinate and manage all aspects of a shared trip. By leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile devices, the Plannel app aims to enhance the travel planning experience and ensure greater satisfaction for all participants.

The project focuses on the design and development of the Plannel mobile application, which will enable users to plan and organise trips. The application will provide a wide range of functions and features to facilitate the management of travel-related information, such as itinerary planning, activity generation and expense tracking.

The application is built using Flutter, a popular open-source framework developed by Google which uses Dart. Flutter allows us to create cross-platform applications that can run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices, ensuring that users can access its features regardless of their preferred mobile operating system. Whether they use an Android smartphone or an iPhone, users will have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits and convenience offered by the Planner app.
